# Activites 12 to 14
This is a compilation of activites from 12 to 14.

## Activity 12:
Activity 12 consists of getting a positive number from the user and calculating the factorial number of it. The factorial calculation goes by `n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) * ... * 1`
### Activity 12 Output:
```
Please input a positive number: 10
Number inputted: 10
Factorial of number: 3628800
```
## Activity 13:
Activity 13 consists of creating a list of temps using the user's input and then calculating the average from the temp via sum. The calculation goes by `list of temperatures divided by number of input`.
### Activity 13 Output:
```
Input how much temps you want to add: 4
1: 40
2: 37
3: 53
4: 45
Average temperature: 43.75
```
## Activity 14:
Activity 14 consists of making a guessing number game using a while loop and randomness. While random isn't entirely random, we can fake it by writing 
```C++
srand(time(NULL));
```
### Activity 14 Output:
```
